# CanSat

This project aims to design and manufacture a CanSat for CanSat competitions. We have opted to employ an Arduino for the Onboard Computer (OBC) of this satellite and an ESP32-Cam for its vision capabilities. The latter is powered by the internet, making it an IoT project.

The components are as follows:
  1. Arduino Mega
  2. BMP180 (Weather condition measurements)
  3. GY-271 (Magnetic electronic compass)
  4. Neo M8 series (GPS module)
  5. GY-521 MPU6050 (Gyroscope)
  6. ESP32-Cam
