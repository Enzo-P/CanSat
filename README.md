# CanSat
Codes for a designed CanSat using Arduino and ESP32

This project is used to design and manufactured a CanSat for CanSat competitions. So we decide to use an Arduino for the OBC of this satellite and an ESP32-cam for vision of this satellite which is powered by internet and is an IoT project.

The components is as below:
  1. Arduino Mega
  2. BMP180 (Wheather condition measurements)
  3. GY-271 (Magnetic electronic compass)
  4. Neo M8 series (GPS module)
  5. GY-521 MPU6050 (Gyroscope)
  6. ESP32-Cam
